// This is the tha assignment for BMIS 365 

// Below I've copied the code from the assignment per the instructions
//Added a single line at the very top of the code with my first and last name
// Added the missing three semicolons to the string, int, and third WriteLine
//Added a note to the string name that it represents a mascot
//Added a note to the int to that it represents the number of mascots
//Created white space between the variables at the top of the code. Created white space between the int and ("The weather...). Created white space between ("The weather...) and if variable.
//Corrected spellings mistakes by capitlizing the l in Writeline and the w in writeline.
//Created indentation once in both the if and else statements.
//Right above the if statement I inserted a multiline comment block that contained the date, current time, a copy of text from the assignment, and my feelings about the Griz.

// Aidan Rasmussen McGee
string name = "Griz"; //This indicates a mascot

int quantity = 1; //This indicates a count for the number of mascots

Console.WriteLine("The weather is phenomenal in Montana.");
